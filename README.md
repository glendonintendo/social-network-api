## Description
The social network api is a complete RESTful API using MondoDB with the Mongoose framework. With the api, users can perform all the relevant CRUD API calls for the Users and Thought models, the basis for a social media application.

MongoDB gives the application the flexibility to grow without the worry of outdating older data through schema updates. The NoSQL database structure allows for any data to be stored within a document, but this flexibility often comes with the cost of duplicated data and possibly inconsistent data across databases.

## Demo
A demonstration video of the API in use can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP6sAokOFhY).

## Installation
 - clone repository to local machine
 - run `npm i` from the command line in the root directory to download the required dependencies
 - run `npm start` to start the server
 - use an API testing software to run API calls or run the calls throught the browser (the default server location is localhost:3001)

## User Story
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
